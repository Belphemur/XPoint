// QuickPageRelayout — shared current-page relayout/paint seam for the quick
// font surfaces (FontPreviewActivity).
//
// quickRelayoutPage() re-lays ONLY the page containing `anchorChar` — the text
// the reader displays at open time (ADR 2026-10-14, page-local relayout). The
// engine's window mode (LayoutParams::windowStartChar, freeink-sdk) skips
// paragraphs that end before the anchor, lays the page containing it, and
// stops at the first page break, so a size step paints in O(one page layout)
// instead of a chapter scan. The delivered page is deep-copied out of the
// per-page arena with QuickPageCapture. The page's line breaks approximate the
// close reindex's (the engine starts at the paragraph boundary containing the
// anchor); the close reindex computes the true pagination.
//
// No committed cache is touched and no FIBP worker state changes; the caller
// owns invalidation, cursor bookkeeping, and the session capture buffer.
